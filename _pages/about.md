Welcome to Wenhao Mu (牟文昊)'s homepage! I'm a first year PhD student from [Computer Science Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/), [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), advised by [Prof. Alexander Rodríguez](https://alrodri.engin.umich.edu/). I received my Master's degree from [School of Computational Science and Engineering
](https://cse.gatech.edu/), [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Prof. Chao Zhang](http://chaozhang.org/).

My research spans across AI-based decision making and time-series forecasting and generative models. l am particularly interested in making trustworthy intelligent system in open-world settings, particularly in the domain of public health and epidemiology. Towardthis goal, l am currently working on the following research thrusts:

- Uncertainty quantification and out-of-distribution detection in deep learning
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Application of uncertainty-aware deep learning in public health, scientific discovery, and natural language processing
